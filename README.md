# UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI - Python 3 Archive

Origionally sourced from: http://ai.berkeley.edu

With Python 2 support coming to a close I thought it would be worthwhile to upgrade and archive a copy of their CS188 Into to AI class.
Most modifications were performed automatically with 2to3 but manual manipulation was required for some things.
This copy does try to stay as close as possible to its source.
The each project and it's autograder were tested but the submission_autograder was not.
