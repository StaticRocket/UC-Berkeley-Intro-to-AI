# UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI - Python 3 Archive

Origionally sourced from: http://ai.berkeley.edu

This is an upgraded and archived copy of UC Berkeley's CS188 Into to AI class projects.

Notes:
- These projects were tested on Python 3.8.1
- Most modifications were performed automatically with 2to3 but manual manipulation was required for some things.
- This copy does try to stay as close as possible to its source.
- Each project and it's autograder were tested but the `submission_autograder.py` was not.
