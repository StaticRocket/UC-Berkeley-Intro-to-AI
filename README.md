# UC Berkeley CS188 Intro to AI - Python 3 Archive

Origionally sourced from: http://ai.berkeley.edu

This is an upgraded and archived copy of UC Berkeley's CS188 Into to AI class projects.

Notes:
- These projects were tested on Python 3.8.1
- Most modifications were performed automatically with 2to3 but manual manipulation was required for some things.
- This copy does try to stay as close as possible to the source.
- Each project and it's autograder were tested but the `submission_autograder.py` was not.


The header of each project's README.html were stripped because they use JavaScript and will occasionally duplicate or try to access assets that aren't available. I deemed it unnecessary given the way these projects are to be distributed and cut it out. The links to source files were left in as a sign of good will and to promote the user to visit the source's site. This was not an attempt to discredit the University of California, Berkeley it was just an attempt to cut some redundant code.
